## Introduction
C is a powerful and widely-used programming language known for its efficiency and low-level control. These programs aim to provide beginners with hands-on experience and a deeper understanding of various concepts in C programming.

## Getting Started
To get started with the programs in this repository, follow these steps:
1. Install a C compiler such as GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) on your local machine.
2. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
3. Open the program files in a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
4. Compile the programs using the C compiler.
5. Run the compiled program to see the output.

## Program List
The repository currently includes the following C programs:

1. [Arithmetic Operators](p1_Arithmetic_operators.c): Demonstrates the usage of arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %) in C.
2. [Relational Operators](p2_Relational_operators.c): Illustrates the usage of relational operators (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=) in C.
3. [Palindrome](p3_Palindrome.c): Checks whether a given number or string is a palindrome.
4. [Armstrong Number](p4_Armstrong.c): Determines if a given number is an Armstrong number.
5. [Fibonacci Series](p5_Fibonacci_series.c): Generates the Fibonacci series up to a specified limit.
6. [Factorial](p6_Factorial.c): Calculates the factorial of a given number.
7. [Matrix Addition](p7_Matrix.c): Adds two matrices and displays the result.
8. [Function](p8_Function.c): Illustrates the use of functions in C.
9. [Swapping Two Integer Numbers using Call by Value](p9_Swapping.c): Swaps two integer numbers using the call by value method.
10. [String Functions](p10_String.c): Demonstrates some commonly used string functions in C.
11. [Pointer](p11_Pointer.c): Shows how to use pointers in C.
12. [Structure](p12_Structure.c): Illustrates the usage of structures in C.

Feel free to explore, modify, and experiment with these programs to enhance your understanding of the C programming language.
